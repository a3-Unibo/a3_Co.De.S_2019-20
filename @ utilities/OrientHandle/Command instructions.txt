OrientHandle

The command is an Orient3Pt simplifications, as it allows the use of "handles" (L - shaped polyline) for orientation.
The command reads L-shaped polylines drawn like this (make sure to respect points order):

  Y - 3rd point
  |
  |
 O.____ X - 1st point
2nd point

STEPS

1. Select the object(s) you want to orient
2. Select "sender" handle
3. Select "receiver" handle

The command does not have a "copy" option, so make sure you are working with a copy of the object that you are orienting.


HINTS

If you want to use the same face both as sender and receiver, be aware than handle orientation decides in which way the objects will be oriented.

Example: if you want to orient a pyramid using its base face in order to get an octahedron, the handles in the base face should be oriented as follows:

. sender handle: X-Y oriented so that their resulting Z axis is directed outward from the face
. receiver handle: rotate the sender handle (making a copy) along its Y axis (its Z will point then inward)
